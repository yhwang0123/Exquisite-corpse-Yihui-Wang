Once upon a time    
there lived three bears in the forest
they were Baby bear, mommy bear and father bear
they lived in a little cottage in the forest
One day they cooked some porriege
But it was too hot
so they went for a walk

In the meantime, some other animals came to their cottage.  
They ate all the porridge.  
When they came back from the forest, it was all empty and they were very sad.
