Once upon a time,      
there lived three bears in the forest.  
They were baby bear, mommy bear and daddy bear.  
They lived in a little cottage in the forest.  
One day they cooked some porridge.  
But it was too hot,  
so they went out for a walk.  
  
In the meantime, some other animals came to their cottage.  
They ate up all the porridge.  
When the three bears came back from the forest, it was all empty and they were very sad.
